# Introduction

On this webpage, you can find an elaborate explanation of my ABE 516X (Data Science and Analytics for Agricultural and Biosystem Engineers) final project. During the course, I learned about research techniques linked with data science ideas and their practical use. The course involved conducting analyses and research on themes connected to Agriculture and Biosystem Engineering and Technology, methods for creating and preserving data analysis pipelines that can be replicated, the best approaches for displaying data visually and presenting data-driven results to diverse audiences, and principles of data ethics and integrity.

During the semester, we learned about various topics and tools that researchers can use in ABE (i.e., Text Scrapping, Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning models, Cloud Shel and Git). Thus, in this project, I will explain how I used five of these research methods and concepts to improve my research on combining and analyzing streaming environment data for anomaly detection in swine production facilities.

Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

#### Header 4

|:-------------|:------------------|:------|
| ok           | good swedish fish | nice  |
| out of stock | good and plenty   | nice  |

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
